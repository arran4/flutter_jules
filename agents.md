# Agent Instructions

## Finalizing
Before finishing a task or submitting changes, you MUST:
1. Run `dart format .` to ensure all code matches the project's style guidelines.
2. Run `flutter analyze` and fix any reported errors or warnings.
3. Run `flutter test`. If the project lacks relevant tests, ensure it builds successfully using `flutter build <platform>` (e.g., `flutter build linux` or `flutter build apk`).
